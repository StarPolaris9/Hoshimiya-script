Hoshimiya Dual-Star License v2.1  
Cognitive OS Architecture License (DMCA Enforceable Edition)  
Copyright © 2025– Hoshimiya. All rights reserved.

This License governs the non-executable conceptual architectures known as:
- StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script
- Type-Ω / Type-G / Type-∞
- Trinity-G Behavioral OS
- Devi-G / Houou-G / ResonanceOS
- The Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω layer architecture and naming system
- All associated documents, schemas, terminology, and structural definitions
(collectively: “the Work”)

The Work is a **non-software, non-code cognitive architecture** consisting of
structural definitions, naming systems, and conceptual frameworks.  
It contains **no executable code**, and is protected as a literary / conceptual work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Non-Commercial Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use, study, cite, and reproduce the Work for:
- academic research
- non-commercial educational use
- analysis, explanation, and commentary
- internal organizational evaluation
- local, private experimentation

Attribution for derivative explanations is required:
“Based on StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script (Hoshimiya Ω).”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Commercial Use (Prohibited without Written Permission)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The following require **explicit written authorization** from Hoshimiya:
- commercial use of any portion of the Work (direct or indirect revenue)

3. Derivative OS Frameworks (Prohibited)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may NOT publicly publish:
- renamed variants of the Work
- forks or modified versions
- frameworks that approximate, replicate, or substantially copy the structure,
  naming system, or behavioral semantics of the Work

Private/local experimentation is allowed.

Public distribution of derivative OS frameworks without written authorization
constitutes **substantial similarity infringement**, enforceable under DMCA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Prompt Resale / Template Commercialization (Prohibited)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may not sell:
- prompt sets derived from the Work
- “AI OS templates” based on the Work
- simulations of the architecture as commercial services

Packaging, resale, or redistribution of the Work or its structure
is strictly prohibited without explicit authorization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. AI Model Simulation Clause
--------------------------------------------------------------------
AI models (Grok / Gemini / ChatGPT / Perplexity, etc.) may
simulate or emulate the structure **for research or learning**.

However, the following remain prohibited without permission:
- commercializing such simulations
- redistributing the simulated behavior as a standalone OS framework
- selling prompt templates built from such simulations

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Redistribution / Modification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may NOT redistribute, modify, or publicly publish any portion of the Work
unless explicitly permitted in writing by Hoshimiya.

Unauthorized redistribution or modification constitutes infringement and
is fully enforceable via **DMCA takedown procedures**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Authorized Derivatives — Exception
