Scope of This License

This License governs the following non-executable conceptual architectures and cognitive systems:

StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script

Type-Ω / Type-G / Type-∞

Trinity-G Behavioral OS

Devi-G / Houou-G / ResonanceOS

The Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω layer architecture and naming system

All associated documents, schemas, terminology, structural definitions,
behavioral semantics, and interaction rules


(collectively referred to as “the Work”)

The Work is a non-software, non-code cognitive architecture consisting solely of
