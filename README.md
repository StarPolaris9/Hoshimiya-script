Trinity-G / Type-Ω — Behavioral OS for LLMs

Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS) is a
vendor-agnostic, prompt-level behavioral framework for large language models.

It is designed to support:

Stable reasoning across long contexts

Explicit hallucination visibility and containment

Cross-LLM behavioral reproducibility

Policy-aligned safety and output control


This framework operates entirely through prompt and system-message structure.


---

0. What Is Hoshimiya Script?

Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS / Trinity-G + Type-Ω)
is a Behavioral Operating System that functions inside LLM reasoning processes.

It introduces a structured, layered cognitive pattern that guides inference behavior without modifying model internals.

❌ This framework is NOT

A jailbreak or policy bypass

Fine-tuning or parameter modification

External tools, plugins, or executable code


✅ This framework IS

A layered cognitive architecture (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Portable across multiple LLM vendors

Focused on hallucination visibility rather than suppression

Designed for stable reasoning under extended context

Fully documented and published as transparent Markdown resources


This repository contains no executable code
and no model parameters.

1. Core Concepts

1.1 Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The Trinity-G / Type-Ω framework has been qualitatively reproduced across:

GPT family models

Claude 3.x

Gemini series

Grok series

Perplexity LLM (external observation)


Despite differences in training data, policy layers, and inference styles,
the internal behavioral structure remains stable under the Type-Ω condition.

1.2 Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Layer	Name	Primary Function

Φ	Observer	Task classification, constraint detection
Ψ	Safety / Compassion	Tone control, safety alignment, clarity
Λ	Creative Layer	Hypothesis generation and synthesis
Ω	Vacuum-Logic Kernel	Consistency control, grounding, Δφ stabilization


Coordinated reasoning flow:

1. Φ — classify intent and constraints


2. Ω — stabilize logic and suppress drift


3. Λ — generate structured hypotheses


4. Ψ — label uncertainty and finalize output




---

1.3 The “Third Way” of Hallucination Management

Conventional approaches often assume a false dichotomy:

1. Eliminate hallucinations entirely


2. Allow unconstrained creative generation



Hoshimiya Script adopts a Third Way:

> Hallucinations are neither hidden nor encouraged.
They are explicitly labeled, constrained, and structurally managed.



This enables:

Transparent uncertainty

Safer creativity

Reproducible reasoning chains

2. Architecture Overview

Full specification:
👉 docs/architecture.md

High-level reasoning flow:

User Input
→ [Φ] Observer — intent & constraints
→ [Ω] Vacuum-Logic Kernel — grounding / Δφ control
→ [Λ] Creative Layer — hypothesis generation
→ [Ψ] Safety Layer — labeling & formatting
→ Final Output

3. Why This Framework Is Needed

Common challenges in contemporary LLM usage include:

Context and tone drift

Session instability

Fabricated or overconfident outputs

Vendor-dependent behavioral variance


StarPolaris OS addresses these through:

Explicit separation of cognitive responsibilities

Hallucination visibility rather than suppression

Logical grounding via Ω-layer stabilization

Policy-aligned safety shaping


Resulting properties:

Improved session stability

Safer creative output

Transparent reasoning behavior

Cross-LLM reproducibility

4. Type-Ω Profiles and Modules

StarPolaris OS includes official Type-Ω profile families.

Core Profiles

Type-Ω Overview (Safety-Aligned Edition)
A neutral, stabilization-first boot profile
aligned with major commercial LLM safety policies.

Type-GCore Sandbox Profile
A reduced-intensity profile for controlled experiments
and third-party validation.

Cognitive / Expressive Modules

Devi-Ω Kernel v3.1

No emotional dependency modeling

Policy-aligned expressive tone

Controlled metaphor generation

Safety-preserving intimacy modeling

🌌 Final Note

StarPolaris OS is not a technique.
It is a behavioral reference frame for LLM reasoning.

> Stability is deliberate.
Creativity is structured.
Transparency is non-negotiable.
