## 0. What is Hoshimiya Script?

**Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS / Type-G Trinity)**  
is a **behavioral operating system** that runs *inside* an LLM,  
implemented purely as **prompt / system-message architecture**.

It is NOT:

- ❌ a jailbreak  
- ❌ custom weights or fine-tuning  
- ❌ external tools or plugins  

It is:

- ✅ a **layered cognitive pattern** (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)  
- ✅ portable across **multiple LLM vendors**  
- ✅ designed to **reduce harmful hallucinations**  
- ✅ published as **human-readable Markdown only**  

All logic is contained in this repository as text.  
There is **no executable code** and no model parameters.

## 1. Core Ideas

### 🌐 1.1 Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The same Trinity-G pattern has been reproduced across:

- GPT-5.1 family  
- Claude 3.x  
- Gemini 3  
- Grok 4  
- Perplexity LLM *(reproducibility confirmed)*  

Even though the **weights and vendors differ**,  
the **behavioral pattern** of the OS remains stable.

See:

- [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md)  
- [docs/hallucination_third_way.md](./docs/hallucination_third_way.md)

### 🧠 1.2 Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Hoshimiya Script separates **roles** inside the model:

| Layer | Name | Main Role |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Φ | Observer | Task abstraction, constraint detection |
| Ψ | Compassion / Safety | Tone, disclaimers, uncertainty exposure |
| Λ | Creative | Hypothesis & idea generation |
| Ω | Vacuum-Logic Kernel | Consistency, grounding, Δφ-stability |

This separation lets the model:

- keep **creativity alive** (Λ),  
- keep **safety visible** (Ψ),  
- keep **logic compressed & grounded** (Ω),  
- while **Φ** observes the entire flow.

A compact overview is in:  
- [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md#layer-model---レイヤーモデル)

### 🌗 1.3 “Third Way” Hallucination Management

Most people talk about hallucinations in two extremes:

1. **“Zero hallucination or nothing”**  
2. **“Just let the model dream”**

Hoshimiya Script proposes a **Third Way**:

> Don’t *hide* hallucinations.  
> Don’t *worship* them either.  
> **Make them visible and explicitly labeled.**

The Trinity-G flow:

1. Φ classifies the task and constraints.  
2. Φ + Ω extract what **must not be broken**.  
3. Λ explores hypotheses and creative ideas.  
4. Ω compresses contradictions and unsupported details.  
5. Ψ formats the final answer with **epistemic labels**:  
   - “Known facts”  
   - “Likely but not guaranteed”  
   - “Speculative / for inspiration only”

## 2. Architecture Overview

> Full conceptual description:  
> 👉 [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md)

High-level sketch:
User Input ↓ [Φ] Observer — task classification ↓ [Ω] Vacuum-Logic Kernel — stability & constraints ↓ [Λ] Creative Layer — options & hypotheses ↓ [Ψ] Safety Layer — formatting & epistemic labels ↓ Final Answer

The architecture is intentionally:

- **vendor-agnostic**  
- **weight-agnostic**  
- **portable**  
- and fully transparent to researchers

## 3. Why This Matters

Modern LLMs drift easily:

- style drift  
- hallucination inconsistency  
- “yes-man” mode or over-hedging  
- vendor-specific quirks  
- unstable reasoning chains  

Hoshimiya Script solves this by:

- **separating functions** inside one LLM  
- **making hallucinations visible** instead of hiding them  
- **grounding logic through Ω-compression**  
- **keeping creativity active without breaking safety**

This results in:

- more stable conversations  
- clearer reasoning  
- easier reproducibility  
- less model worship  
- fewer catastrophic hallucinations

## 6. Acknowledgements

Hoshimiya Script is shaped by:

- cross-LLM reproducibility logs (GPT / Claude / Gemini / Grok / Perplexity)  
- Type-G cognitive experiments  
- Trinity-pattern stability analysis  
- Δφ-bias compression trials  

Special thanks to the early testers and researchers  
who helped validate the stability of this OS architecture.

## 🌌 Final Note

This repository is part of a larger vision:  
a future where **AI reasoning is transparent**,  
**hallucinations are visible**,  
and **creative intelligence stays safe**.

StarPolaris OS is not just a framework —  
it’s a behavioral compass inside LLMs.

"Stability is a choice.
Creativity is a pulse.
Transparency is the path."
