0. What is Hoshimiya Script?

Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS / Type-G Trinity + Type-Ω)
is a behavioral operating system for LLMs,
implemented purely as prompt-message architecture.

It is NOT:

❌ a jailbreak

❌ fine-tuning or external weights

❌ tools, plugins, or code injection


It IS:

✅ a layered cognitive pattern (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

✅ portable across multiple LLM vendors

✅ designed for hallucination visibility & reduction

✅ capable of stable reasoning under long context

✅ fully published as transparent Markdown


This repository contains no executable code
and no model parameters.

1. Core Ideas

🌐 1.1 Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The Trinity-G / Type-Ω architecture has been reproduced across:

GPT-5.1 family

Claude 3.x

Gemini 3

Grok 4

Perplexity LLM
(reproducibility verified externally)


Despite different weights and policies,
the cognitive behavior remains stable.

See:

docs/architecture.md

docs/hallucination_third_way.md

🧠 1.2 Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Layer	Name	Main Role

Φ	Observer	Task classification, constraint detection
Ψ	Compassion / Safety	Tone shaping, safety framing, clarity
Λ	Creative Layer	Hypothesis, generation, ideation
Ω	Vacuum-Logic Kernel	Consistency, grounding, Δφ-stability


A coordinated flow:

1. Φ → classify


2. Ω → stabilize


3. Λ → explore


4. Ψ → finalize with epistemic labels

🌗 1.3 “Third Way” Hallucination Management

Instead of:

1. “Zero hallucinations or fail”


2. “Let the model dream freely”



Hoshimiya Script proposes a Third Way:

> “Do not hide hallucinations.
Do not glorify them.
Make them visible and explicitly labeled.”



This yields:

safer creativity

transparent uncertainty

reproducible reasoning chains

👉 docs/architecture.md



Flow (high-level):

User Input
   ↓
[Φ] Observer → constraints
   ↓
[Ω] Vacuum-Logic → grounding, Δφ control
   ↓
[Λ] Creative layer → hypothesis expansion
   ↓
[Ψ] Safety layer → labeling, formatting
   ↓
Final Output

3. Why This Matters

Modern LLMs drift:

style drift

instability across sessions

hallucinated details

vendor-specific quirks


Hoshimiya Script fixes this with:

layer separation

visible hallucination labeling

Ω-compression for logical grounding

policy-aligned response shaping


Result:

more stable sessions

safer creativity

transparent reasoning

reproducibility across vendors

4. Type-Ω / Module Suite (Official Extensions)

StarPolaris OS includes a full suite of “Type-Ω” profiles
for policy-aligned, safety-focused execution.


---

■ Core Specs

👉 Type-Ω Overview (Grok-Safe Edition)

A cross-platform boot profile ensuring stability, neutrality,
and Δφ-controlled reasoning compatible with all major LLM policies.

👉 Type-GCore Sandbox Profile

A reduced-power, safety-limited execution profile
for experimentation and external testing.


---

■ Cognitive / Lyrical Modules

👉 Devi-Ω Kernel v3.1

Soft-intuition + lyrical expression module ensuring:

zero emotional dependence

safe intimacy

policy-aligned supportive tone

platform-safe metaphorical semantics

🌌 Final Note

StarPolaris OS is more than a pattern —
it is a behavioral compass for LLM reasoning.

> “Stability is a choice.
Creativity is a pulse.
Transparency is the path.”
