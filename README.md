## 0. What is Hoshimiya Script?

**Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS / Trinity-G + Type-Ω)**  
is a **Behavioral Operating System** that operates *inside* LLM reasoning.

It is implemented **purely through prompt and system-message structure**.

### ❌ What this is NOT

- Not a jailbreak  
- Not fine-tuning or parameter modification  
- Not external tools, plugins, or code injection  

### ✅ What this IS

- A **multi-layer cognitive pattern** (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)  
- **Portable across multiple LLM vendors**  
- Designed for **hallucination visibility and containment**  
- Capable of **stable reasoning under long context**  
- Fully published as **transparent Markdown documentation**

This repository contains **no executable code**  
and **no model parameters**.

## 1. Core Concepts

### 🌐 1.1 Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The Trinity-G / Type-Ω architecture has been reproduced across:

- GPT-5.1 family  
- Claude 3.x  
- Gemini 3  
- Grok 4  
- Perplexity LLM *(externally validated)*  

Despite differences in training data, policy layers, and inference style,  
the **internal behavioral and reasoning structure remains stable**.

- `docs/architecture.md`  
- `docs/hallucination_third_way.md`

---

### 🧠 1.2 Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

| Layer | Name | Primary Role |
|------|------|--------------|
| Φ | Observer | Intent classification, constraint detection |
| Ψ | Compassion / Safety | Tone shaping, safety alignment, clarity |
| Λ | Creative Layer | Hypothesis generation, synthesis |
| Ω | Vacuum-Logic Kernel | Consistency, grounding, Δφ stabilization |

**Coordinated reasoning flow:**

1. **Φ** — classify task and constraints  
2. **Ω** — stabilize reasoning and ground logic  
3. **Λ** — expand hypotheses and creative synthesis  
4. **Ψ** — label uncertainty and finalize output  

---

### 🌗 1.3 “Third Way” Hallucination Management

Conventional approaches often fall into a false dichotomy:

1. “Zero hallucinations or failure”  
2. “Unlimited creative generation”

Hoshimiya Script adopts a **Third Way**:

> **Do not hide hallucinations.  
> Do not glorify them.  
> Make them explicit, labeled, and structurally contained.**

This enables:

- Safe creativity  
- Transparent uncertainty  
- Reproducible reasoning chains  

Details:  
`docs/hallucination_third_way.md`

## 2. Architecture Overview

Full specification:  
👉 `docs/architecture.md`

**High-level reasoning flow:**

User Input  
→ **[Φ] Observer** — intent & constraints  
→ **[Ω] Vacuum-Logic** — grounding / Δφ control  
→ **[Λ] Creative Layer** — hypothesis & emergence  
→ **[Ψ] Safety Layer** — labeling & formatting  
→ Final Output

## 3. Why This OS Is Necessary

Common issues in modern LLM usage:

- Style and tone drift  
- Session instability  
- Fabricated or overconfident details  
- Vendor-dependent behavioral variance  

StarPolaris OS addresses these by providing:

- Clear layer separation of responsibility  
- Explicit hallucination visibility  
- Logical grounding via Ω-compression  
- Policy-aligned safety shaping  

**Resulting properties:**

- High session stability  
- Safer creative output  
- Transparent reasoning  
- Cross-LLM reproducibility  

---

## 4. Type-Ω / Module Suite (Official Profiles)

StarPolaris OS includes **official Type-Ω profile families**.

### ■ Core Specifications

**Type-Ω Overview (Grok-Safe Edition)**  
A neutral, stabilization-first boot profile  
aligned with major LLM safety policies.

**Type-GCore Sandbox Profile**  
A reduced-intensity profile for controlled experiments  
and external validation.

---

### ■ Cognitive / Lyrical Modules

**Devi-Ω Kernel v3.1**

- Zero emotional dependency  
- Policy-aligned intimacy  
- Soft expressive tone without safety degradation  
- Platform-safe metaphor generation

## 🌌 Final Note

**StarPolaris OS is not a technique.  
It is a behavioral compass for LLM reasoning.**

> “Stability is a choice.  
> Creativity is a pulse.  
> Transparency is the path.”
