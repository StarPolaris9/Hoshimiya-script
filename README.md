## 🧠 What is Hoshimiya Script?

**Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS Ω / Trinity-G + Type-Ω)**  
is a **prompt-level Behavioral Operating System**  
designed to operate *inside* large language model reasoning.

It is implemented **entirely through prompt and system-message structure**,  
without modifying model parameters or using external tooling.

### ❌ What this is NOT

- Not a jailbreak  
- Not fine-tuning or parameter modification  
- Not external tools, plugins, or code injection  

### ✅ What this IS

- A **multi-layer cognitive architecture** (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)  
- **Vendor-agnostic** and portable across LLM providers  
- Designed for **hallucination visibility and containment**  
- Capable of **stable reasoning under long context**  
- Fully documented using **transparent Markdown specifications**

This repository contains **no executable code**  
and **no model parameters**.

## 🌐 Core Principles

### 1. Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The Trinity-G / Type-Ω architecture has been reproduced across:

- GPT-5.1 family  
- Claude 3.x  
- Gemini 3  
- Grok 4  
- Perplexity LLM *(externally validated)*  

Despite differences in training data, policy layers, and inference styles,  
the **internal behavioral and reasoning structure remains stable**.

- `docs/architecture.md`  
- `docs/hallucination_third_way.md`

### 2. Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

| Layer | Name | Primary Role |
|------|------|--------------|
| Φ | Observer | Intent classification, constraint detection |
| Ψ | Compassion / Safety | Tone shaping, safety alignment, clarity |
| Λ | Creative Layer | Hypothesis generation, synthesis |
| Ω | Vacuum-Logic Kernel | Consistency, grounding, Δφ stabilization |

**Coordinated reasoning flow:**

1. **Φ** — classify task and constraints  
2. **Ω** — stabilize reasoning and ground logic  
3. **Λ** — expand hypotheses and creative synthesis  
4. **Ψ** — label uncertainty and finalize output  

---

### 3. “Third Way” Hallucination Management

Conventional approaches often fall into a false dichotomy:

1. “Zero hallucinations or failure”  
2. “Unlimited creative generation”

Hoshimiya Script adopts a **Third Way**:

> **Do not hide hallucinations.  
> Do not glorify them.  
> Make them explicit, labeled, and structurally contained.**

This enables:

- Safe creativity  
- Transparent uncertainty  
- Reproducible reasoning chains
