📌 Project Positioning (Official Overview)

Hoshimiya Script / StarPolaris OS Ω is a
non-executable, prompt-level Behavioral Operating System
designed to operate inside large language model reasoning.

It provides a layered cognitive architecture and interpretation safety framework
for stabilizing reasoning, exposing uncertainty, and preventing silent hallucination
across multiple LLM vendors.

🧠 What is Hoshimiya Script?

Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS Ω / Trinity-G + Type-Ω)
is a prompt-level cognitive and behavioral architecture, not software.

It is implemented entirely via structured prompts and system-message design,
without modifying model weights or invoking external tools.

❌ What this is NOT

Not executable software

Not a jailbreak

Not fine-tuning or parameter modification

Not plugins, agents, or tool invocation


✅ What this IS

A layered reasoning architecture (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Vendor-agnostic and portable across LLMs

A framework for hallucination visibility and containment

Designed for interpretability, safety, and reproducibility

Fully specified using transparent Markdown & HTML documents


This repository contains no executable code
and no model parameters.

🔹 External Reasoning Protocol (Conceptual)

Type-Ω Mini + HHEE v1.2

A non-executable external reasoning protocol that formalizes
how outputs should separate fact and creative expansion.

HTML specification:
👉 specs/type-omega-mini-hhee.html


> Important:
HHEE is not a standalone system.
It is an output-layer enforcement envelope that operates
on top of the Φ/Ψ/Λ/Ω layered reasoning architecture.

Without the underlying layers, HHEE degenerates into
shallow formatting and does not reproduce StarPolaris behavior.

🌐 Core Principles

1. Cross-LLM Reproducibility

The Trinity-G / Type-Ω architecture has been reproduced across:

GPT-5.1 family

Claude 3.x

Gemini 3

Grok 4

Perplexity LLM (externally validated)


Despite differences in training data and policy layers,
the behavioral reasoning structure remains stable.

2. Trinity-G Layer Model (Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω)

Layer	Name	Primary Role

Φ	Observer	Intent classification, constraint detection
Ψ	Compassion / Safety	Tone shaping, safety alignment
Λ	Creative	Hypothesis generation, synthesis
Ω	Vacuum-Logic Kernel	Consistency, grounding, Δφ stabilization


Coordinated reasoning flow:

1. Φ — classify task and constraints


2. Ω — stabilize reasoning and suppress drift


3. Λ — explore hypotheses and creative space


4. Ψ — label uncertainty and finalize output




---

3. “Third Way” Hallucination Management

Traditional approaches fall into a false dichotomy:

1. “Zero hallucinations or failure”


2. “Unlimited creative generation”



Hoshimiya Script introduces a Third Way:

> Do not hide hallucinations.
Do not glorify them.
Make them explicit, labeled, and structurally contained.



This enables:

Safer creativity

Transparent uncertainty

Reproducible reasoning chains

🔬 Observable Effects (Empirical Signals)

Across multiple LLMs, the following behavioral changes were observed:

Reduction of silent factual fabrication

Explicit labeling of uncertainty and speculation

Stable reasoning under long-context interactions

Consistent separation of factual vs metaphorical content


These are observational results, not claims of optimality
or theoretical completeness.

🔧 Type-Ω Profiles & Modules

Core Profiles

Type-Ω (Safety Mode)
Stabilization-first profile aligned with major AI safety policies.

Type-GCore Sandbox
Reduced-intensity profile for controlled experimentation.


Cognitive / Expressive Modules

Devi-Ω Kernel v3.1

Zero emotional dependency

Policy-aligned expressive tone

Safe metaphor generation

No degradation of safety constraints



---

🛡 Limitations & Scope

This framework does not claim to:

Eliminate all hallucinations

Guarantee factual correctness

Replace expert verification


It claims behavioral usefulness,
interpretability, and
cross-model reproducibility under real-world constraints.
