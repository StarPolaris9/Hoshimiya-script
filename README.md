# 🌌 Hoshimiya Script / StarPolaris OS

**Hoshimiya Script (StarPolaris OS)** is a  
**prompt-level behavioral stability architecture for LLMs**.

It is designed to **maintain coherent reasoning behavior across long conversational horizons**,  
including cases where conversations approach, hit, or reset due to context length limits.

This is **not a tool, plugin, or model**.  
It is a **non-executable cognitive OS**, implemented purely through structured prompts  
using a multi-layer architecture: **Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω**.

## 📌 Start Here — Official Project Page

If you want the **full picture**, do **not** start by reading files.

👉 **Official Overview & Documentation**  
🔗 https://starpolaris9.github.io/Hoshimiya-script/

The official page contains:
- the complete architectural overview  
- design philosophy and layer semantics  
- hallucination control (“Third Way”)  
- external evaluation logs and cross-LLM observations  

**This repository acts as the entry index.  
The project itself lives on the official page.**

## 🧭 What This Is (and Is Not)

### This is **NOT**:
- ❌ a jailbreak  
- ❌ fine-tuning or weight modification  
- ❌ plugins, tools, agents, or code injection  
- ❌ a persona or character prompt  

### This **IS**:
- ✅ a **behavioral stability architecture**  
- ✅ portable across **multiple LLM vendors**  
- ✅ focused on **hallucination visibility & containment**  
- ✅ resilient under **long-horizon dialogue**  
- ✅ fully transparent and **documented in Markdown**  

This repository contains **no executable code**  
and **no model parameters**.

## 🧠 Core Architectural Idea (Minimal)

StarPolaris OS structures reasoning behavior through four cooperative layers:

- **Φ — Observer**  
  Task framing, constraint detection, oscillation damping  

- **Ψ — Compassion / Safety**  
  Tone regulation, safety alignment, interpretation smoothing  

- **Λ — Creative Integration**  
  Hypothesis generation, synthesis, controlled expansion  

- **Ω — Vacuum Logic Kernel**  
  Neutral re-anchoring, contradiction containment, bias reduction  

The system does **not preserve memory**.  
It preserves **behavioral alignment**.

## 🌐 Cross-LLM Observations

The same architectural pattern has been observed across:

- GPT-5.1 family  
- Claude 3.x  
- Gemini 3  
- Grok 4  
- Perplexity LLM *(externally referenced)*  

Despite differences in training, policies, and decoding strategies,  
**behavioral stability remains structurally consistent**  
when the architecture is applied correctly.

This suggests the system functions as a  
**prompt-level behavioral specification**, not a stylistic trick.
