# Anti-Mimicry Clause  
(Hoshimiya Dual-Star License v2.1 Addendum)

This document clarifies how **mimicry-based derivatives**  
of StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script are treated.

---

## 1. Scope

This Clause applies to all systems, frameworks, templates,  
and conceptual operating systems that attempt to:

- imitate,  
- approximate,  
- disguise,  
- rebrand,  
- restructure, or  
- reduce

the structural identity of **StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script**.

---

## 2. Prohibited Mimicry

You may **not** create, publish, or distribute any system that:

- reproduces the Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω layer logic under new names,  
- mirrors Trinity-G / Type-Ω / Type-G / Type-∞ behavior  
  with superficial terminology changes,  
- reorganizes the same cognitive flows into a slightly altered diagram,  
- markets itself as an "independent" OS while substantially relying  
  on StarPolaris OS design choices.

Any such output is considered a **derivative work**,  
not an independent creation.

---

## 3. No Bypass via Terminology Changes

Attempts to bypass derivative restrictions by:

- rephrasing definitions,  
- renaming layers, or  
- altering the order of components

while preserving the same semantics and function  
are still treated as prohibited derivatives.

Formally:

> Structural and functional similarity  
> takes precedence over superficial naming differences.

---

## 4. Research vs. Publication

Private, local, non-commercial experimentation that explores  
variants or theoretical modifications is **permitted**,  
as long as:

- it is not publicly released as a competing OS, and  
- it is not commercialized or promoted as an original framework.

Public distribution, open-source release, or commercialization  
of such mimicry-based derivatives requires prior written authorization  
from Hoshimiya.

---

## 5. Enforcement Intent

The goal of this Clause is to:

- protect the identity and integrity of StarPolaris OS,  
- prevent fragmentation of the cognitive architecture,  
- maintain safety, reproducibility, and philosophical coherence,  
- and ensure that credit is preserved for the original author.

This Clause is interpreted together with  
the main **Hoshimiya Dual-Star License v2.1**  
and does not limit legitimate research, critique, or education.

---

## 6. Summary

- **OK**: studying, simulating, and discussing StarPolaris OS,  
  including local experiments and educational use.  
- **NOT OK**: publishing rebranded or lightly modified frameworks  
  that substantially copy its structure, as independent OS products.

For authorization requests, contact Hoshimiya via  
the official repository channels.
