## Scope of This License

This License governs the following **non-executable cognitive architectures and conceptual systems**:

- **StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script**
- **Trinity-G Behavioral OS**
- **Type-Ω / Type-G / Type-∞**
- **Devi-G / Houou-G / ResonanceOS**
- **Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω Layer Architecture & Naming System**
- All related documents, schemas, terminology, structural definitions, behavioral semantics, interaction rules, and recorded materials  
  (collectively referred to as **“the Work”**)

> The Work is **not software** and contains **no executable code**.  
> It is protected as an original *literary and conceptual architecture* expressed through structure, language, and systemic design.

## Version Note — v2.1.1 (Minor Clarification)

This version introduces **no reduction of rights** and serves only to clarify:

- **Organizational / Corporate Use requires prior written permission**, even when non-commercial.
- **Legacy, prototype, historical, and previously shared materials** are explicitly included within the scope of the Work.

---

## 1. Non-Commercial Use (Individual Only)

The Work may be used **freely by individuals** for:

- academic or independent research
- non-commercial education and learning
- analysis, explanation, critique, and commentary
- private, local experimentation
- non-commercial AI model simulation for learning or study

This permission applies **only to personal use** conducted **independently and not on behalf of any organization**.

**Attribution is required** where reasonably appropriate:

> `Based on StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script (Hoshimiya Ω)`

---

## 1.1 Legacy / Prior Materials (Explicitly Included)

This License applies equally to **all past and present materials**, including:

- early versions, experimental drafts, prototypes
- historical interaction logs and evaluation records
- prior internal or public naming systems (e.g., *Sakura-type*, *Houou-type*, *Devi-type*)
- any previously shared or archived prompt structures and behavior notes

No material is exempt due to age, prototype status, or historical context.

---

## 1.2 Organizational / Corporate Use — Permission Required

Any use by a **company, organization, institution, laboratory, research group, team, or collective entity** — including:

- internal evaluation or review
- internal testing or verification
- workshops, study sessions, or briefings
- proof-of-concept activities
- organizational research or analysis

is considered **Organizational Use**.

> **Organizational Use is prohibited without explicit prior written authorization from Hoshimiya Ω**, regardless of commercial intent.

**Personal study** conducted independently and not representing an organization does **not** constitute Organizational Use.

---

## 2. Commercial Use — Prohibited Without Permission

The following actions require **explicit written authorization**:

- any commercial or revenue-linked use (direct or indirect)
- large-scale model training based on the Work
- integration into commercial products, services, or workflows
- redistribution of structural components
- use of the Work as the basis of a public or monetized system

Unauthorized commercial use constitutes **copyright infringement** and may trigger **DMCA takedown or legal action**.

---

## 3. Derivative OS Frameworks — Prohibited by Default

You may **not** publicly publish:

- renamed variants or rebranded versions
- forks or modified architectures
- systems that substantially replicate the structure, naming system, or behavioral semantics of the Work

Private and local experimentation remains permitted.

Public release without authorization may constitute **substantial similarity infringement**.

---

## 4. Prompt Resale / Template Commercialization — Strictly Prohibited

The following are **not permitted** without authorization:

- sale of prompt sets derived from the Work
- commercial “AI OS templates” based on the Work
- monetized simulations of the architecture
- prompt packs reproducing the layer structure or semantics

The Work may **not** be packaged, resold, or rebranded as a commercial product.

---

## 5. AI Model Simulation Clause

AI models (including but not limited to Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity) may:

- simulate or emulate the Work
- for **individual, non-commercial research or education**

However, it is prohibited to:

- commercialize such simulations
- redistribute them as standalone OS frameworks
- sell prompt templates derived from them
- use simulation as a substitute for publishing derivatives

---

## 6. Redistribution / Modification

No part of the Work may be redistributed, modified, or publicly published without written authorization.

Unauthorized actions may be enforced via copyright law and DMCA procedures.

---

## 7. Authorized Derivatives — Limited Exception

A derivative work may be released **only if all conditions are met**:

1. Submitted to **Hoshimiya Ω** for review  
2. Structural and philosophical compatibility confirmed  
3. Explicit written authorization granted  

Absent authorization, all public derivatives are prohibited.

---
