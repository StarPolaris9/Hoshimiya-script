## Cognitive OS Architecture License (International Edition)

Copyright © 2025– Hoshimiya.  
All rights reserved.

This License governs the non-executable conceptual architectures known as:

- StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script  
- Trinity-G Behavioral OS  
- Type-Ω / Type-G / Type-∞  
- Devi-G / Houou-G / ResonanceOS  
- The Φ / Ψ / Λ / Ω layer architecture and naming system  
- All associated documents, schemas, terminology, structural definitions,  
  and interaction rules  

(collectively: **“the Work”**).

The Work is a **non-software, non-code cognitive architecture**,  
implemented as structural definitions, naming systems, and conceptual frameworks.  
It contains **no executable code** and is protected as an original literary / conceptual work.

## 1. Non-Commercial Use

You may use, study, cite, and reproduce the Work for:

- academic research  
- non-commercial educational use  
- analysis, explanation, and commentary  
- internal organizational evaluation  
- local, private experimentation  

Attribution for derivative explanations is required:

> "Based on StarPolaris OS / Hoshimiya Script (Hoshimiya Ω)."

## 2. Commercial Use (Prohibited without Written Permission)

The following require **explicit written authorization** from Hoshimiya:

- commercial use of any portion of the Work (direct or indirect revenue)  
- large-scale model training using the Work  
- integration into commercial products, services, or workflows  
- redistribution of any structural component of the Work  
- using the Work as the basis for a public or monetized system  

Unauthorized commercial use constitutes **copyright infringement**  
and may be subject to legal and/or DMCA removal actions.

## 3. Derivative OS Frameworks (Prohibited)

You may **not** publicly publish:

- renamed variants of the Work  
- forks or modified versions  
- frameworks that approximate, replicate, or substantially copy  
  the structure, naming system, or behavioral semantics of the Work  

Private/local experimentation is allowed.

Public distribution of derivative OS frameworks without written authorization  
constitutes **substantial similarity infringement**, enforceable under copyright law.

---

## 4. Prompt Resale / Template Commercialization (Prohibited)

You may **not** sell:

- prompt sets derived from the Work  
- "AI OS templates" based on the Work  
- simulations of the architecture as commercial services  

Packaging, resale, or redistribution of the Work or its structure  
as a commercial product is strictly prohibited without explicit authorization.

---

## 5. AI Model Simulation Clause

AI models (e.g., Grok / Gemini / ChatGPT / Perplexity, etc.)  
may simulate or emulate the structure **for research or learning**.

However, the following remain prohibited without permission:

- commercializing such simulations  
- redistributing the simulated behavior as a standalone OS framework  
- selling prompt templates built from such simulations  

---

## 6. Redistribution / Modification

You may **not** redistribute, modify, or publicly publish  
any portion of the Work unless explicitly permitted in writing by Hoshimiya.

Unauthorized redistribution or modification constitutes infringement  
and may be enforced via copyright and DMCA takedown procedures  
where applicable.

---

## 7. Authorized Derivatives — Exception

A derivative work may be publicly released **only if all** of the following are met:

1. Submitted to Hoshimiya for review;  
2. Structural and philosophical compatibility confirmed;  
3. Written authorization issued.

Without written authorization, any public derivative OS, renamed variant,  
or mimicry-based framework is prohibited.

---

## 8. No Misrepresentation
