## 4. Contractual Binding (International Contract Principles)

The License language:

> "Commercial use prohibited without written permission"

functions as a contractual condition.

are considered to accept these terms where such clickwrap / browsewrap  
mechanisms are recognized.

Violation may constitute both **copyright infringement**  
and **breach of contract**, depending on jurisdiction.

## 5. Derivative OS Restriction

Publishing:

- renamed OS frameworks,  
- structural approximations,  
- reorganized layer systems, or  
- derivative architectures

that substantially copy the structure or semantics of the Work  
is treated as creation of an infringing **derivative work**.

Private/local experimentation remains permitted.  
Public release requires written authorization from Hoshimiya.

## 6. Enforcement Tools

Depending on jurisdiction, the following remedies may be available:

- DMCA takedown (U.S.)  
- Copyright infringement claims (civil)  
- Contract breach claims  
- Removal from public repositories and hosting services  

The goal is not punitive, but to protect:

- structural integrity of the cognitive architecture,  
- safety and reproducibility of research,  
- philosophical coherence of the system design.
